Blog web app using Spring full stack technologies with a MVC pattern, dependency injection, full Jupiter testing suite, MySQL datastore, security and authentication for administrative and content creator roles, with ThymeLeaf View Engine, Bootstrap, and the Tiny MCE editor API on the front end to allow for full CRUD of static or non-static multimedia blog posts that can post and expire on schedule
